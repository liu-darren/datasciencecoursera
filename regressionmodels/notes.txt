father of regression: Francis Galton
parent's height to children's height

- questions to answer for regression
- find a parsimonious, easily described mean relationship between two variables
- investigate variation of response that is residual to input (residual)
- quantify what impact additional information has beyond current input
- figure out what assumptions are needed to generalize beyond the data (inference)
- 

i. least squares
install.packages(‘usingR’)
library(manipulate)
- interesting method, the origin is now the mean
lm (I(y - mean(y)) ~ I(x - mean(x)) - 1, data = …)

Y = B0 + B1X1, where B1 = cor(Y, X) ( sd(Y) / sd(X) )
