#### WEEK 1 ####
Principles of Analytic Graphics

1. Show comparisons
2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
- given topic and how the variable effects the subjects under issue
3. Show multivariate data
4. Integration of evidence
- make use of words, numbers, images
- not limited to the tool
5. Describe and document with appropriate labels, scales, sources
6. Content is king

Exploratory Graphs
- for you to understand ...
data properties
patterns in data
suggest modeling strategies
debug analyses
communicate results

- they are made quickly
- a large number are made
- axes/legends cleaned up later
- color/size used for information

simple summaries of data
* one dimension
- five number summary
- boxplots
- histograms
- density plot
- barplot

summmary() gives 5 number summary & mean

2 dimension
- scatterplots

> 2 dimension
- use color, size, shape to add dimensions
- spinning plots

with() ?

R Graph Gallery for inspiration

Plotting systems in R
- "Artist's palette" model
- start with blank canvas and build
- use annotations (text, lines, points, axis)

Lattice system: library(lattice)
- plots created with a single call
- most useful for conditioning types of plots: how y changes with x across levels of z

ggplot2
- adding layers
- good defaults

The Base Plotting Systems
- graphics: includes plot, hist, boxplot
- grDevices: contains all the codes implementing various graphics devices: X11, PDF, PostScript, PNG
Lattice
- lattice: produce Trellis graphics, include yxplot bwplot, levelplot
- grid: lattice builds on top of it, rarely call its functions directly

- plot
make scatterplot, or other types depending on the class of the object
- lines
add lines to a plot
- points
add points
- text
add text labels to a plot using xy coords
- title
add annotations to x, y axis labels
- mtext
add arbitrary text to margins
- axis
add axis ticks/labels
- par
par(
	mfrow=c(1,2), # number of facets
	mfcol=c(2, 1), # same idea except columsn get filled first
	mar=c(4,4,2,1), # margins of all 4 sides
	oma=c(0,0,2,0)
	)
 
Graphics Device
- window on computer (screen device), PDF, PNG, JPEG, SVG (file devices)
- most common is screen device
quartz() for mac
windows() for windows
x11() for linux

- file devices are exported out
- vector formats
can be too large for plots with large numbe of points
- pdf
useful for line-type graphics, resizes well, usually portable
- svg
XML-based scalable vector graphics, good for web
- win.metafile
only for windows, outdated
- graphic file

- bitmap formats
- png
bitmapped format, good for drawing with solid colors
- jpeg
does not resize well, good for plotting many many points
- tiff
something else
- bmp
used for icons

- may open multiple graphics device, but can only graph to one at once
- dev.cur() shows what device you're on
- dev.set() takes integer value and takes you to the device
- dev.copy() copy plot from once device to another
- dev.copy2pdf() copies screen plot to pdf file, may not be exact
